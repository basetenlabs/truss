### `description`

Describe your model for documentation purposes.
### `environment_variables`

<Warning>
Do not store secret values directly in environment variables (or anywhere in the config file). See the `secrets` arg for information on properly managing secrets.
</Warning>

Any environment variables can be provided here as key value pairs and are exposed to the environment that the model executes in. Many Python libraries can be customized using environment variables, so this field can be quite handy in those scenarios.

```yaml
environment_variables:
  ENVIRONMENT: Staging
  DB_URL: https://my_database.example.com/
```

### `model_metadata`
Set any additional metadata in this catch-all field. The entire contents of the config file are available to the model at runtime, so this is a good place to store any custom information that model needs. For example, scikit-learn models include a flag here that indicates whether the model supports returning probabilities alongside predictions.

```yaml
model_metadata:
  supports_predict_proba: true
```

### `requirements`

List the Python dependencies that the model depends on. The requirements should be provided in the [pip requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/), but as a yaml list.

We strongly recommend pinning versions in your requirements.

```yaml
requirements:
- scikit-learn==1.0.2
- threadpoolctl==3.0.0
- joblib==1.1.0
- numpy==1.20.3
- scipy==1.7.3
```

### `resources`

#### `resources.cpu`

#### `resources.memory`

#### `resources.use_gpu`

#### `resources.accelerator`

### `secrets`
<Warning>
This field can be used to specify the keys for such secrets and dummy default
values. ***Never store actual secret values in the config***. Dummy default
values are instructive of what the actual values look like and thus act as
documentation of the format.
</Warning>

A model may depend on certain secret values that can't be bundled with the model
and need to be bound securely at runtime. For example, a model may need to download
information from s3 and may need access to AWS credentials for that.

```yaml
secrets:
  hf_access_token: "ACCESS TOKEN"
```

### `system_packages`
Specify any system packages that you would typically install using `apt` on a Debian operating system.

```yaml
system_packages:
- ffmpeg
- libsm6
- libxext6
```

### `runtime`

#### `runtime.predict_concurrency`


### `external_package_dirs`


### `build`


#### `build.model_server`

#### `build.arguments`
