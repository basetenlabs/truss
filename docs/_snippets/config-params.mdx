### `model_name`

Name of your model
### `description`

Describe your model for documentation purposes.
### `model_class_name`
(default: `Model`)

The name of the class that defines your Truss model. Note that this class must implement
at least a `predict` method.
### `model_module_dir`
(default: `model`)

Folder in the Truss where to find the model class.
### `data_dir`
(default: `data/`)

Folder where to place data files in your Truss. Note that you can access this within your model like so:


```python model/model.py
class Model:
  def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    data_dir = kwargs["data_dir"]

  ...
```


### `environment_variables`

<Warning>
Do not store secret values directly in environment variables (or anywhere in the config file). See the `secrets` arg for information on properly managing secrets.
</Warning>

Any environment variables can be provided here as key value pairs and are exposed to the environment that the model executes in. Many Python libraries can be customized using environment variables, so this field can be quite handy in those scenarios.

```yaml
environment_variables:
  ENVIRONMENT: Staging
  DB_URL: https://my_database.example.com/
```

### `model_metadata`
Set any additional metadata in this catch-all field. The entire contents of the config file are available to the model at runtime, so this is a good place to store any custom information that model needs. For example, scikit-learn models include a flag here that indicates whether the model supports returning probabilities alongside predictions.

```yaml
model_metadata:
  supports_predict_proba: true
```

This is also where display metdata can be stored

### `requirements`

List the Python dependencies that the model depends on. The requirements should be provided in the [pip requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/), but as a yaml list.

We strongly recommend pinning versions in your requirements.

```yaml
requirements:
- scikit-learn==1.0.2
- threadpoolctl==3.0.0
- joblib==1.1.0
- numpy==1.20.3
- scipy==1.7.3
```

### `resources`

The `resources` section is where you specify the compute resources that your model needs. This includes CPU, memory, and GPU resources.
If you need a GPU, you must also set `resources.use_gpu` to `true`.

#### `resources.cpu`

CPU resources needed, expressed as either a raw number, or "millicpus". For example, `1000m` and `1` are equivalent.
Fractional CPU amounts can be requested using millicpus. For example, `500m` is half of a CPU core.

#### `resources.memory`

CPU RAM needed, expressed as a number with units. Units acceptable include "Gi" (Gibibytes), "G" (Gigabytes), "Mi" (Mebibytes), and"M" (Megabytes). For example, `1Gi` and `1024Mi` are equivalent.

#### `resources.use_gpu`

Whether or not a GPU is required for this model.

#### `resources.accelerator`

Which GPU you would like for your instance. Available Nvidia GPUs supported in Truss include:
* T4
* L4
* A10G
* V100
* A100

Note that if you need multiple GPUs to server your model, you can use the `:` operator to request multiple
GPUs on your instance, eg:

```yaml
resources:
  ...
  accelerator: A10G:2 # Requests 2 A10Gs

```


### `secrets`
<Warning>
This field can be used to specify the keys for such secrets and dummy default
values. ***Never store actual secret values in the config***. Dummy default
values are instructive of what the actual values look like and thus act as
documentation of the format.
</Warning>

A model may depend on certain secret values that can't be bundled with the model
and need to be bound securely at runtime. For example, a model may need to download
information from s3 and may need access to AWS credentials for that.

```yaml
secrets:
  hf_access_token: "ACCESS TOKEN"
```

### `system_packages`
Specify any system packages that you would typically install using `apt` on a Debian operating system.

```yaml
system_packages:
- ffmpeg
- libsm6
- libxext6
```

### `python_version`

Which version of Python you'd like to use. Supported versions include:

* py39
* py310
* py311

### `base_image`

The `base_image` option is used if you need to bring your own custom base image.
Custom base images are useful if there are scripts that need to run at build time, or dependencies
that are complicated to install. After creating a custom base image, you can specify it
in this field.

See [Custom Base Images](guides/base-images) for more detail on how to use these.

#### `base_image.image`

A path to the docker image you'd like to use, as
an example, `nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:23.03`.

####  `base_image.python_executable_path`

A path to the Python executable on the image. For instance, `/usr/bin/python`.

Tying it together, a custom base image configuration might look
like this:

```yaml
base_image:
  image: nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:23.03
  python_executable_path: /usr/bin/python
  ```
### `runtime`

Runtime settings for your model instance.

#### `runtime.predict_concurrency`
(default: `1`)

This field governs how much concurrency can run in the predict method of your model. This is useful
if you have a model that has support for parallelism, and you'd like to take advantage of that.
By default, this value is set to 1, implying that `predict` can only run for one request at a time.
This protects the GPU from being over-utilized, and is a good default for many models.

See [How to configure concurrency](guides/concurrency) for more detail on how to set this value.
### `external_data`

Use `external_data` if you have data that you want to be bundled in your image at build time.
This is useful if you have a large amount of data that you want to be available to your model.
By including it at build-time, you reduce the cold-start time of your instance, as the data is
already available in the image. You can use it like so:

```yaml config.yaml
external_data:
- url: https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/my-data.tar.gz
  local_data_path: data/my-data.tar.gz
  name: my-data
```
#### `external_data.<list_item>.url`

The URL to download data from.
#### `external_data.<list_item>.local_data_path`

The path on the image where the data will be downloaded to.
#### `external_data.<list_item>.name`

You can set a name for the data, which is useful for readability-purposes.
Not required.
### `build`

The `build` section is used to define options for custom servers.
The two main model servers we support are `TGI` an `vLLM`. These are
highly optimized servers that are built to support specific LLMs.

See the following examples for how to use each of these:
* [TGI](examples/07-high-performance-tgi)
* [vLLM](examples/08-high-performance-vllm)

Example configuration for TGI, running Falcon-7B:

```yaml config.yaml
build:
  arguments:
    endpoint: generate_stream
    model_id: tiiuae/falcon-7b
  model_server: TGI
```

#### `build.model_server`

Either `VLLM` for vLLM, or `TGI` for TGI.

#### `build.arguments`

The arguments for the model server. This includes information such as which model you intend to load, and
which endpoin from the server you'd like to use.

### `hf_cache`

The `hf_cache` section is used for caching model weights at build-time. This is one of the biggest levers
for decreasing cold start times, as downloading weights can be one of the lengthiest parts of starting a new
model instance. Using this section ensures that model weights are cached at _build_ time.

See the [model cache guide](guides/model-cache) for the full details on how to use this field.

<Note>
  Despite the fact that this field is called the `hf_cache`, there are multiple backends supported, not just Hugging Face. You can
  also cache weights stored on GCS, for instance.
</Note>

#### `hf_cache.<list_item>.repo_id`

The endpoint for your cloud bucket. Currently, we support Hugging Face and Google Cloud Storage.

Example: `madebyollin/sdxl-vae-fp16-fix` for a Hugging Face repo, or `gcs://path-to-my-bucket` for
a GCS bucket.

#### `hf_cache.<list_item>.revision`

Points to your revision. This is only relevant if you are pulling By default, it refers to `main`.

#### `hf_cache.<list_item>.allow_patterns`

Only cache files that match specified patterns. Utilize Unix shell-style wildcards to denote these patterns.
By default, all paths are included.

#### `hf_cache.<list_item>.ignore_patterns`

Conversely, you can also denote file patterns to ignore, hence streamlining the caching process.
By default, nothing is ignored.
