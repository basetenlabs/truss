# Manually

Creating a Truss manually, from a serialized model, works with any model-building framework, including from-scratch bespoke models.

To get started, initialize the Truss with the following command:

```
truss init my_truss
```

### Truss structure

To build a Truss manually, you have to understand the package in much more detail than using it with a supported framework. Fortunately, that's what this doc is for!

To familiarize yourself with the structure of Truss, review the [structure reference](../reference/structure.md). A Truss only has a few files that you need to interact with, and this tutorial is an opinionated guide to working through them.

### Adding the model binary

First, you'll need to add a model binary to your new Truss. On supported frameworks, this is provided automatically by the `mk_truss` command. For a custom Truss, it can come from many sources, such as:

* Pickling your model
* Serializing your model
* Downloading a serialized model from the internet

This file should be put in the folder `data/model/` as, for example, `model.joblib` (replace `joblib` with the appropriate extension for your serialized model).

This model binary must be de-serialized in the model class.

### Building the model

The model file implements the following functions, in order of execution:

* A constructor `__init__` to initiate the class
* A function called `load`, called **only** once, and that call is guaranteed to happen before **any** predictions are run
* A function `preprocess`, called once before **each** prediction
* A function `predict` that actually runs the model to make a prediction
* A function `postprocess`, called once after **each** prediction



Having both a constructor and a load function means you have flexibility on when you download and/or deserialize your model. There are three possibilities here, and we strongly recommend the second one:

1. Load model in the constructor, but it's not a good idea to block constructor
2. Load in the load function.
3. Load lazily on first prediction, but this gives your model service a cold start issue

Also, your model gets access to certain values, including the `config.yaml` file for configuration and the `data` folder where you previously put the serialized model.

Once your model is created, you'll likely need to develop it further, see the next section for everything you need to know about local development!
