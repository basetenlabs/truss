Truss is maintained by [Baseten](https://baseten.co), which provides infrastructure for running ML models in production. We'll use Baseten as the remote host for your model.

### Get an API key

To set up the Baseten remote, you'll need a [Baseten API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/account/api_keys). If you don't have a Baseten account, no worries, just [sign up for an account](https://app.baseten.co/signup/) and you'll be issued plenty of free credits to get you started.

### Deploy your Truss

Deploying a model with Truss uses the interactive `truss push` command. The first time you run the command, it will walk you through setting up and a remote host to run your model.

With your Baseten API key ready to go, you can deploy your model:

```sh
truss push
```

You'll be prompted for a few setup values. To complete the deployment:

1. Accept the default value for remote url (`https://app.baseten.co`)
2. Paste your API key when prompted
3. Give the model a name, like `my-first-model`

You can monitor your model deployment on [your model dashboard on Baseten](https://app.baseten.co/models/).

```python model/model.py
from typing import Any


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._data_dir = kwargs["data_dir"]
        self._config = kwargs["config"]
        self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        # Load model here and assign to self._model.
        pass

    def predict(self, model_input: Any) -> Any:
        return model_input
```
