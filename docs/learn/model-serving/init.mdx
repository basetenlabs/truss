This tutorial will guide you step-by-step through:

1. Creating a Truss
2. Connecting your local development environment to a model server
3. Deploying a [basic text classification model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.pipeline)
4. Publishing your model to production

<Tip>
On the right side, you'll see what your Truss should look like after each step!
</Tip>

### Install the Truss package

Make sure you're using the newest version of Truss to complete this tutorial:

```sh
pip install --upgrade truss
```

### Create your Truss

Use the `truss init <folder-name>` command to create a Truss.

```sh
truss init my-first-truss
```

When prompted, give your Truss a name like `My First Truss`

### Get ready to code!

Navigate to the newly created directory:

```sh
cd my-first-truss
```

Open the directory in your favorite text editor, such as Visual Studio Code.

```python model/model.py
class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        pass

    def predict(self, model_input):
        return model_input
```

```yaml config.yaml

model_name: My First Truss
