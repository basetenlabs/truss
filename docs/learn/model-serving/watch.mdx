title: "Step 3: Enable live reload"
description: "Patch the model server with local changes"

You don't have to run `truss push` every time you update your Truss during development. Instead, you can have a live reload workflow where local changes automatically are pushed to the production environment to give you a lightning-fast feedback loop.

### Watch for changes

<Tip>
Run the `truss watch` command in a new terminal tab in the same working directory, as you'll need to leave it running while you work.
</Tip>

In a new terminal tab in the same `my-first-truss` working directory, run:

```sh
truss watch
```

Now, as you update your Truss, the changes will be patched onto the model server on the remote host.

### Use `truss watch` while working

In the next three steps, we'll deploy a basic ML model to our model server. Check your `truss watch` tab and model logs on Baseten after each step to see the changes you make locally reflected live on your model server.

Leave `truss watch` running in this new terminal tab for the rest of the tutorial. You can use `Control-C` to exit `truss watch` and stop automatically pushing changes.

```python model/model.py
class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        pass

    def predict(self, model_input):
        return model_input
```

```yaml config.yaml

model_name: My First Truss

  accelerator: null
