You don't have to run `truss push` every time you update your Truss during development. Instead, you can have a live reload workflow where local changes automatically are pushed to the production environment to give you a lightning-fast feedback loop.

### Set up Truss watch

In a new terminal tab, run:

```sh
truss watch
```

Now, as you update your Truss, the changes will be patched onto the model server on the remote host.

Leave `truss watch` running in this new terminal tab for the rest of the tutorial. You can use `Control-C` to exit `truss watch` to stop automatically pushing changes.

In the next three steps, we'll upgrade our echo server to instead run an ML model. Check the output of `truss watch` after every step to see your local changes reflected live on the production server!

```python model/model.py
from typing import Any
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._data_dir = kwargs["data_dir"]
        self._config = kwargs["config"]
        self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input: Any) -> Any:
        return self._model(model_input)
```
