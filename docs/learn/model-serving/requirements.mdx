title: "Step 6: Set requirements"
description: "Add the model's Python requirements to the model server."

This step introduces the other essential file in a Truss: `my-truss/config.yaml`, which controls the model server's configuration. For a complete list of the config options, see [the config reference](/reference/config).

<Warning>
Note that the `model_name` parameter is already set to `my-first-model` or whatever name you picked the first time you ran `truss push`. Don't change this name as it must remain consistant with the remote host.
</Warning>

### Add Python requirements

All configuration for your model happens in `config.yaml`.

We'll set Python requirements. ML moves fast, always pin your requirements to make sure you're getting the right version.

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Code">
```yaml config.yaml
requirements:
  - torch==2.0.1
  - transformers==4.30.0
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Diff">
```diff config.yaml
- requirements: []
+ requirements:
+   - torch==2.0.1
+   - transformers==4.30.0
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
You can set system requirements the same way with `system_packages`.
</Info>

On your `truss watch` tab, you should see that the model server is no longer showing an error.

```yaml config.yaml  ●
environment_variables: {}
external_package_dirs: []
model_metadata: {}
model_name: my-first-truss
python_version: py39
requirements:
  - torch==2.0.1
  - transformers==4.30.0
resources:
  accelerator: null
  cpu: 500m
  memory: 512Mi
  use_gpu: false
secrets: {}
system_packages: []
```

```python model/model.py
from typing import Any
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._data_dir = kwargs["data_dir"]
        self._config = kwargs["config"]
        self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input: Any) -> Any:
        return self._model(model_input)
```
