In this step, we'll upgrade to an actual ML model: a text classification/sentiment analysis model that will tell us if a snippet of text has a positive or negative tone.

<Tip>
On the right side, you'll see what your Truss should look like after each step!
</Tip>

The `transformers` Python package is useful for working with all kinds of models, including the large language model (LLM) that we're going to work with in the Truss 201 module. It has a `pipeline` function that gives you access to a number of simple models with minimal config.

### Import transformers

Let's import `transformers.pipeline` at the top of `model/model.py`:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
```

### Load the model

In Truss, the `Model.load()` function runs once when the model server is spun up.

We'll update `load()` to use the `text-classification` model from `transformers.pipeline`.

-    pass

```

We're not going to deploy the updated model just yet, there are two more changes that need to be made first.

```python model/model.py  ●
from typing import Any
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._data_dir = kwargs["data_dir"]
        self._config = kwargs["config"]
        self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input: Any) -> Any:
        return model_input
```
