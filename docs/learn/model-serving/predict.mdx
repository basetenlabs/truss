Once your model server has finished deploying, you can call it from your terminal.

### Call the model server

Model server input must be JSON-serializable: a string, number, list, or dictionary.

<Note>
Note the double quotes to make the data parameter a string.

`truss predict` uses the same data formatting on the as cURL.
</Note>

**Invocation**

```sh
truss predict -d '"Truss is awesome!"'
```

**Response**

```json
"Truss is awesome!"
```

Our model server is up and responding to requests. In the next step, we'll set up the last piece of the developer loop on Truss.

<RequestExample>

```python model/model.py
class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        pass

    def predict(self, model_input):
        return model_input
```

```yaml config.yaml
environment_variables: {}
model_name: My First Truss
requirements: []
resources:
  accelerator: null
  cpu: "1"
  memory: 2Gi
  use_gpu: false
secrets: {}
system_packages: []
```
