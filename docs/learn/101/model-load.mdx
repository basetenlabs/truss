title: "Step 5: Load a model"
description: "Description"

In this step, we'll upgrade to an actual ML model.

`transformers` is a Python package for working with all kinds of models, including the large language model (LLM) that we're going to work with in the Truss 201 module. It has a `pipeline` function that gives you access to a number of simple models with minimal config.

Let's import it at the top of `model/model.py`:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
```

The model loading function runs once when the model server is spun up.

We'll update `load()` to bring in the `text-classification` model.

```python model/model.py  ●
from typing import Any
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._data_dir = kwargs["data_dir"]
        self._config = kwargs["config"]
        self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input: Any) -> Any:
        return model_input
```
