title: Deploy a Truss on Baseten
description: "Use Baseten as a Truss remote"
---

Truss is maintained by [Baseten](https://baseten.co), which provides infrastructure for running ML models in production. Baseten can be used as a remote host for your Truss models.

## Get an API key

To set up the Baseten remote, you'll need a [Baseten API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/account/api_keys). If you don't have a Baseten account, no worries, just [sign up for an account](https://app.baseten.co/signup/) and you'll be issued plenty of free credits to get you started.

## Set the remote during `truss push`

When you run `truss push` for the first time, you'll be prompted for a URL and API key and your Baseten remote will be set up automatically.

```sh
cd my-truss
truss push
```

## Advanced usage

### Set the remote manually

You can also configure your Baseten remote manually by opening the `~/.trussrc` file in a text editor and pasting the following information (replace the placeholder `api_key` value):

```txt ~/.trussrc
[baseten]
remote_provider = baseten
api_key = abcdefgh.1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKL1234567890
remote_url = https://app.baseten.co
```

### Use multiple Baseten remotes

If you have multiple Baseten remotes that you push to, you can give them unique names in the `~/.trussrc` file:

```txt ~/.trussrc
[cloud-baseten]
remote_provider = baseten
api_key = abcdefgh.1234567890ABCDEFGHIJKL1234567890
remote_url = https://app.baseten.co
[self-hosted-baseten]
remote_provider = baseten
api_key = hgfedcba.0987654321ABCDEFGHIJKL0987654321
remote_url = https://baseten.example.com
```

You'll be prompted to select a remote during `truss push` if you have multiple remotes.
