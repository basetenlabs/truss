<ParamField body="description" type="str">
Describe your model for documentation purposes.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="environment_variables" type="Dict[str, str]">
<Warning>
Do not store secret values directly in environment variables (or anywhere in the
config file). See the `secrets` arg for information on properly managing secrets.
</Warning>
Any environment variables can be provided here as key value pairs and are exposed
to the environment that the model executes in. Many Python libraries can be
customized using environment variables, so this field can be quite handy in those
scenarios.
```yaml
environment_variables:
  ENVIRONMENT: Staging
  DB_URL: https://my_database.example.com/
```
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="model_metadata" type="Dict[str, str]">
Set any additional metadata in this catch-all field. The entire contents of the
config file are available to the model at runtime, so this is a good place to
store any custom information that model needs. For example, scikit-learn models
include a flag here that indicates whether the model supports returning
probabilities alongside predictions.
```yaml
model_metadata:
  supports_predict_proba: true
```
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="model_name" type="str">
The model's name, for documentation purposes.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="requirements_file" type="str">
Path of the requirements file with the required Python dependencies.
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="requirements" type="List[str]">
List the Python dependencies that the model depends on. The requirements should
be provided in the
[pip requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/),
but as a yaml list. These requirements are installed after the ones from `requirements_file`.
We strongly recommend pinning versions in your requirements.
```yaml
requirements:
- scikit-learn==1.0.2
- threadpoolctl==3.0.0
- joblib==1.1.0
- numpy==1.20.3
- scipy==1.7.3
```
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="resources" type="Dict[str, str]">
Specify model server runtime resources such as CPU, RAM and GPU.
```yaml
resources:
  cpu: "3"
  memory: 14Gi
  use_gpu: true
  accelerator: A10G
```
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="secrets" type="Dict[str, str]">
<Warning>
This field can be used to specify the keys for such secrets and dummy default
values. ***Never store actual secret values in the config***. Dummy default
values are instructive of what the actual values look like and thus act as
documentation of the format.
</Warning>
A model may depend on certain secret values that can't be bundled with the model
and need to be bound securely at runtime. For example, a model may need to download
information from s3 and may need access to AWS credentials for that.
```yaml
secrets:
  hf_access_token: "ACCESS TOKEN"
```
</ParamField>
<ParamField body="system_packages" type="List[str]">
Specify any system packages that you would typically install using `apt` on a Debian operating system.
```yaml
system_packages:
- ffmpeg
- libsm6
- libxext6
```
</ParamField>
