Truss is configurable to its core. Every Truss must include a file config.yaml in its root directory, which is automatically generated when the Truss is created. However, configuration is optional. Every configurable value has a sensible default, and a completely empty config file is valid.

<Accordion title="YAML syntax help">
YAML syntax can be a bit non-obvious when dealing with empty lists and dictionaries. You may notice the following in the default Truss config file:

```yaml
requirements: []
secrets: {}
```

When you fill them in with values, lists and dictionaries should look like this:

```yaml
requirements:
  - dep1
  - dep2
secrets:
  key1: default_value1
  key2: default_value2
```
</Accordion>

## Example

Here's an example config file for a Truss that uses the [WizardLM](https://huggingface.co/WizardLM/WizardLM-7B-V1.0) model:

```yaml WizardLM config
description: An instruction-following LLM Using Evol-Instruct.
environment_variables: {}
model_name: WizardLM
requirements:
- accelerate==0.20.3
- bitsandbytes==0.39.1
- peft==0.3.0
- protobuf==4.23.3
- sentencepiece==0.1.99
- torch==2.0.1
- transformers==4.30.2
resources:
  cpu: "3"
  memory: 14Gi
  use_gpu: true
  accelerator: A10G
secrets: {}
system_packages: []
```
