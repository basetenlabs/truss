title: Welcome to Truss
description: "The simplest way to serve AI/ML models in production"
---

## Why Truss?

* **Write once, run anywhere:** Package and test model code, weights, and dependencies with a model server that behaves the same in development and production.
* **Fast developer loop:** Implement your model with fast feedback from a live reload server, and skip Docker and Kubernetes configuration with a batteries-included model serving environment.
* **Support for all Python frameworks**: From `transformers` and `diffusors` to `PyTorch` and `Tensorflow` to `XGBoost` and `sklearn`, Truss supports models created with any framework, even entirely custom models.

See Trusses for popular models including:

* 🦙 [Llama 2](/examples/models/llama-2)
* 🎨 [Stable Diffusion XL](/examples/models/sdxl)
* 🗣 [Whisper](/examples/models/whisper)

and [dozens more examples on GitHub](https://github.com/basetenlabs/truss-examples/).
