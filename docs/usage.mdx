description: "Get up and running quickly with Truss' developer workflow"
---

We built Truss because we were frustrated with the long feedback loops in ML model deployment. When you have to wait for your server to rebuild every time you make a change, iteration is painful.

Meanwhile, web developers have enjoyed live reload workflows for years, where changes are patched onto a running server and available almost instantly.

With Truss, you get the same live reload workflow for serving ML models.

## Create a Truss

```sh
truss init TARGET_DIRECTORY
```

A Truss is an abstraction for a model server. But more literally, it's a set of files. Running `truss init` creates those files in a target directory.

To package a model with Truss, follow the [quickstart](/quickstart), a [step-by-step example](/examples), or an [example from GitHub](https://github.com/basetenlabs/truss-examples/).

See the CLI reference for more information on [truss init](/reference/cli/init).

## Spin up model server

```sh
truss push
```

A model server takes requests, passes them through an ML model, and returns the model's output. When you're ready to start testing your Truss, use `truss push` to spin up a model server with your model and config.

See the CLI reference for more information on [truss init](/reference/cli/push).

## Test the model

```sh
truss predict
```

Once your model server is live, you can invoke your model with `truss predict`.

See the CLI reference for more information on [truss predict](/reference/cli/predict).

## Watch for changes

<Tip>
Run the `truss watch` command in a new terminal tab in the same working directory, as you'll need to leave it running while you work.
</Tip>

```sh
truss watch
```

When you make a change with `truss watch` running, it will automatically attempt to patch that change onto the model server. Most changes to `model.py` and `config.yaml` can be patched.

<Warning>
The following changes should not be made in a live reload workflow:

* Updates to `resources` in `config.yaml`, which must be set before the first `truss push`
* Changes to the `model_name` in `config.yaml`. Changing the model name requires a new `truss push` to create a new model server.
</Warning>

See the CLI reference for more information on [truss watch](/reference/cli/watch).

## Publish your model

Once you're happy with your model, stop `truss watch` and run:

```sh
truss push --publish
```

This will re-build your model server on production infrastructure.

## Use model in production

To invoke the published model, run:

```sh
truss predict --published
```

With [Baseten](https://baseten.co) as your [remote host](/remotes/baseten), your model is served behind [autoscaling infrastructure](https://docs.baseten.co/managing-models/resources) and is [available via an API endpoint](https://docs.baseten.co/building-with-models/invoke).
