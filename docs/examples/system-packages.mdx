title: Model with system packages
description: "Deploy a model with both Python and system dependencies"
---

## Summary

To add system packages to your model serving environment, open `config.yaml` and update the `system_packages` key with a list of apt-installable Debian packages.

Example code:

```yaml config.yaml
system_packages:
- tesseract-ocr
```

## Step-by-step example

[LayoutLM Document QA](https://huggingface.co/impira/layoutlm-document-qa) is a multimodal model that answers questions about provided invoice documents.

The model requires a system package, `tesseract-ocr`, which we need to include in the model serving environment.

<Tip>
You can see the code for the finished LayoutLM Document QA Truss on the right. Keep reading for step-by-step instructions on how to build it.
</Tip>

This example will cover:

1. Implementing a `transformers.pipeline` model in Truss
2. Adding Python requirements to the Truss config
3. **Adding system requirements to the Truss config**
4. Setting sufficient model resources for inference

### Step 0: Initialize Truss

Get started by creating a new Truss:

```sh
truss init layoutlm-document-qa
```

Give your model a name when prompted, like `LayoutLM Document QA`. Then, navigate to the newly created directory:

```sh
cd layoutlm-document-qa
```

### Step 1: Implement the `Model` class

LayoutLM Document QA is [a pipeline model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines), so it is straightforward to implement in Truss.

In `model/model.py`, we write the class `Model` with three member functions:

* `__init__`, which creates an instance of the object with a `_model` property
* `load`, which runs once when the model server is spun up and loads the `pipeline` model
* `predict`, which runs each time the model is invoked and handles the inference. It can use any JSON-serializable type as input and output.

[Read the quickstart guide](/quickstart) for more details on `Model` class implementation.

```python model/model.py
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        # Load the model from Hugging Face
        self._model = pipeline(
            "document-question-answering",
            model="impira/layoutlm-document-qa",
        )

    def predict(self, model_input):
        # Invoke the model and return the results
        return self._model(
            model_input["url"],
            model_input["prompt"]
        )
```

### Step 2: Set Python dependencies

Now, we can turn our attention to configuring the model server in `config.yaml`.

In addition to `transformers`, LayoutLM Document QA has three other dependencies. We list them below as follows:

```yaml config.yaml
requirements:
- Pillow==10.0.0
- pytesseract==0.3.10
- torch==2.0.1
- transformers==4.30.2
```

<Note>
Always pin exact versions for your Python dependencies. The ML/AI space moves fast, so you want to have an up-to-date version of each package while also being protected from breaking changes.
</Note>

### Step 3: Install system packages

One of the Python dependencies, `pytesseract`, also requires a system package to operate.

Adding system packages works just like adding Python requirements. You can specify any package that's available via `apt` on Debian.

```yaml config.yaml
system_packages:
- tesseract-ocr
```

### Step 4: Configure model resources

LayoutLM Document QA doesn't require a GPU, but you'll need a midrange CPU instance if you want reasonably fast invocation times. 4 CPU cores and 16 GiB of RAM is sufficient for the model.

Model resources are also set in `config.yaml` and must be specified before you deploy the model.

```yaml config.yaml
resources:
  cpu: "4"
  memory: 16Gi
  use_gpu: false
  accelerator: null
```

### Step 5: Deploy the model

<Note>
You'll need a [Baseten API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/account/api_keys) for this step.
</Note>

We have successfully packaged LayoutLM Document QA as a Truss. Let's deploy!

```sh
truss push --publish
```

For development with hot reload, use `truss push --watch` instead.

You can invoke the model with:

```sh
truss predict -d '{"url": "https://templates.invoicehome.com/invoice-template-us-neat-750px.png", "prompt": "What is the invoice number?"}'
```
