[TGI](https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/tree/main) is a model server optimized for
language models. In this example, we put together a Truss that serves the model Falcon 7B using TGI.

For Trusses that use TGI, there is no user code to define, so there is only a config.yaml file.
You can run any model that supports TGI.

```yaml config.yaml
build:
  arguments:
```
The endpoint argument has two options:
  * **generate**: This returns the response as JSON when the full response is generated
  * **generate_stream**: If you choose this option, results will be streamed as they are ready, using
    server-sent events

```yaml config.yaml
    endpoint: generate_stream
```
Select the model that you'd like to use with TGI

```yaml config.yaml
    model: tiiuae/falcon-7b
```
The `model_server` parameter allows you to specify a supported backend (in this example, TGI)

```yaml config.yaml
  model_server: TGI
```
Another important parameter to configure if you are choosing TGI is the `predict_concurrency`.
One of the main benefits of TGI is continuous batching -- in which multiple requests can be
processed at the same time. Without `predict_concurrency` set to a high enough number, you cannot take advantage of this
feature.

```yaml config.yaml
runtime:
  predict_concurrency: 128
```
The remaining config options listed are standard Truss Config options.

```yaml config.yaml
environment_variables: {}
external_package_dirs: []
model_metadata: {}
model_name: Falcon-TGI
python_version: py39
requirements: []
resources:
  accelerator: A10G
  cpu: "4"
  memory: 16Gi
  use_gpu: true
secrets: {}
system_packages: []
```
# Deploy the model

Deploy the TGI model like you would other Trusses, with:
```bash
$ truss push
```
You can then invoke the model with:
```bash
$ truss predict -d '{"inputs": "What is a large language model?", "parameters": {"max_new_tokens": 128, "sample": true}}' --published
```
