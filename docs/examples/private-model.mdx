title: Private Hugging Face model
description: "Load a model that requires authentication with Hugging Face"

## Summary

To load a gated or private model from Hugging Face:

1. Create an [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) on your Hugging Face account.
2. Add the `hf_access_token` key to your `config.yaml` secrets and value to your [Baseten account](https://app.baseten.co/settings/secrets).
3. Add `use_auth_token` to the appropriate line in `model.py`.

Example code:

<CodeGroup>
```yaml config.yaml
secrets:
  hf_access_token: null
```

```python model/model.py
self._model = pipeline(
    "fill-mask",
    model="baseten/docs-example-gated-model",
    use_auth_token=self._secrets["hf_access_token"]
)
```
</CodeGroup>

## Step-by-step example

[BERT base (uncased)](https://huggingface.co/bert-base-uncased) is a masked language model that can be used to infer missing words in a sentence.

While the model is publicly available on Hugging Face, we copied it into a gated model to use in this tutorial. The process is the same for using a gated model as it is for a private model.

<Tip>
You can see the code for the finished private model Truss on the right. Keep reading for step-by-step instructions on how to build it.
</Tip>

This example will cover:

1. Implementing a `transformers.pipeline` model in Truss
2. **Securely accessing secrets in your model server**
3. **Using a gated or private model with an access token**


### Step 0: Initialize Truss

Get started by creating a new Truss:

```sh
truss init private-bert
```

Give your model a name when prompted, like `Private Model Demo`. Then, navigate to the newly created directory:

```sh
cd private-bert
```

### Step 1: Implement the `Model` class

BERT base (uncased) is [a pipeline model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines), so it is straightforward to implement in Truss.

In `model/model.py`, we write the class `Model` with three member functions:

* `__init__`, which creates an instance of the object with a `_model` property
* `load`, which runs once when the model server is spun up and loads the `pipeline` model
* `predict`, which runs each time the model is invoked and handles the inference. It can use any JSON-serializable type as input and output.

[Read the quickstart guide](/quickstart) for more details on `Model` class implementation.

```python model/model.py
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline(
            "fill-mask",
            model="baseten/docs-example-gated-model"
        )

    def predict(self, model_input):
        return self._model(model_input)
```

### Step 2: Set Python dependencies

Now, we can turn our attention to configuring the model server in `config.yaml`.

BERT base (uncased) has two dependencies:

```yaml config.yaml
requirements:
- torch==2.0.1
- transformers==4.30.2
```

<Note>
Always pin exact versions for your Python dependencies. The ML/AI space moves fast, so you want to have an up-to-date version of each package while also being protected from breaking changes.
</Note>

### Step 3: Set required secret

Now it's time to mix in access to the gated model:

1. Go to the [model page on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/baseten/docs-example-gated-model) and accept the terms to access the model.
2. Create an [access token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) on your Hugging Face account.
3. Add the `hf_access_token` key and value to your [Baseten workspace secret manager](https://app.baseten.co/settings/secrets).
4. In your `config.yaml`, add the key `hf_access_token`:

```yaml config.yaml
secrets:
  hf_access_token: null
```

<Warning>
Never set the actual value of a secret in the `config.yaml` file. Only put secret values in secure places, like the Baseten workspace secret manager.
</Warning>

### Step 4: Use access token in load

In `model/model.py`, you can give your model access to secrets in the init function:

```python model/model.py
def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
        self._model = None
```

Then, update the load function with `use_auth_token`:

```python model/model.py
self._model = pipeline(
    "fill-mask",
    model="baseten/docs-example-gated-model",
    use_auth_token=self._secrets["hf_access_token"]
)
```

This will allow the `pipeline` function to load the specified model from Hugging Face.

### Step 5: Deploy the model

<Note>
You'll need a [Baseten API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/account/api_keys) for this step.
</Note>

We have successfully packaged a gated model as a Truss. Let's deploy!

```sh
truss push --publish
```

For development with hot reload, use `truss push --watch` instead.

Wait for the model to finish deployment before invoking.

You can invoke the model with:

```sh
truss predict -d '"It is a [MASK] world"'
```
