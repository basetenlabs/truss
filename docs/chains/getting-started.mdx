# Prerequisites

Install Chains in your python development environment

```bash
pip install truss==0.9.14rc1
```

For deploying Chains remotely to Baseten you need
a [Baseten account](https://app.baseten.co/signup).

# Creating your first *Chain*

<Info>
A *Chain* is the result of defining one or several *Chainlets* and linking
them to each other by marking Chainlet dependencies and making function
calls to other Chainlets.

A Chainlet is the fundamental building block, it performs one computation
step (e.g. model inference). Each will be deployed as a separate, scalable
remote service.

More details are in the [concepts section](/chains/concepts).
</Info>

Create a Chain project directory with a python file in it. You can chose a name
and location, in this example we assume the file is named `hello.py`.

-- Note: If you are changing this snippet, please update the starter code in cli.py
```python
import random
import truss_chains as chains

class RandInt(chains.ChainletBase):
    def run_remote(self, max_value: int) -> int:
        return random.randint(1, max_value)

@chains.mark_entrypoint
class HelloWorld(chains.ChainletBase):
    def __init__(self, rand_int=chains.depends(RandInt, retries=3)) -> None:
        self._rand_int = rand_int

    def run_remote(self, max_value: int) -> str:
        num_repetitions = self._rand_int.run_remote(max_value)
        return "Hello World! " * num_repetitions
```

This Chainlet takes an integer, and returns the string "Hello World!" repeated a
variable number of times.

## Explanations

* `run_remote` contains your user-defined implementation and is the entrypoint
  to invoke a Chainlet. Other Chainlets
  may *only* use the `run_remote` method of their dependency Chainlets.
* To support input and output serialization in remote execution, `run_remote`
  must be fully type-annotated with
  <Tooltip tip="E.g. `int`, `str`, `list[float]`">primitive python
  types</Tooltip> or
  <Tooltip tip="They have builtin JSON serialization.">[pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)</Tooltip>.
* A chainlet must not have any other *public* methods or attributes,
  besides `run_remote`. You can use private methods
  to structure you implementation. This is to allow the transformation of your
  local code to remote deployment.
* Chainlets cannot be <Tooltip tip="I.e. creating instances like `chainlet = RandInt()` in arbitrary locations in your code.">
  naively</Tooltip>
  instantiated. The only correct usages are 1) via the `chains.depends()`
  directive as an `__init__`-argument as shown above
  for `RandInt` and 2) in the
  local [debugging mode](/chains/guide#local-debugging).
* `@chains.mark_entrypoint` is a simple marker to denote which Chainlet acts as
  the entrypoint to receive client requests.
* Bear in mind that Chainlets are intended for *distributed, replicated, remote
  execution*, so using global variables,
  state
  and <Tooltip tip="E.g. changing classes and imported modules dynamically at runtime.">
  highly dynamic python
  features</Tooltip> should be avoided as they might not work as intended.

# Remote Deployment to Baseten

To deploy your Chain to in a remote hosting environment
like [Baseten](https://www.baseten.co/), run the following
command:

```bash
truss chains deploy ./hello.py
```

This Truss command has the following structure:
`truss chains deploy [OPTIONS] SOURCE ENTRYPOINT` where `ENTRYPOINT` is the
Chainlet class name in your python file.
For more options run `truss chains deploy --help`. `ENTRYPOINT` can be omitted
if `@chains.mark_entrypoint` is used.

The deploy command results in an output like this:

```
                  ⛓️   HelloWorld - Chainlets  ⛓️
╭──────────────────────┬─────────────────────────┬─────────────╮
│ Status               │ Name                    │ Logs URL    │
├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────┤
│  💚 ACTIVE           │ HelloWorld (entrypoint) │ https://... │
├──────────────────────┼─────────────────────────┼─────────────┤
│  💚 ACTIVE           │ RandInt (dep)           │ https://... │
╰──────────────────────┴─────────────────────────┴─────────────╯
Deployment succeeded.
You can run the chain with:
curl -X POST 'https://.../predict' \
    -H "Authorization: Api-Key $BASETEN_API_KEY" \
    -d '<JSON_INPUT>'
```

Wait for the status to turn to `ACTIVE` and test invoking your Chain: copy+paste
the displayed `curl` command and replace `JSON_INPUT`:

```bash
curl -X POST $PREDICT_URL \
  -H "Authorization: Api-Key $BASETEN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"max_value": 10}'
# "Hello World! Hello World! Hello World! "
```


# What's next?

Now you know how to wire two Chainlets together and deploy them
remotely. Possible extensions from here are:
* Create more complex structures:
  * Wiring more than two chains together.
  * Calling `run_remote` in a loop or using conditional control flow.
* Benefit from a fast dev loop with
  [local debugging mode](/chains/guide#local-debugging-with-mock)
  -- with partial mocking.
* Deploy Chainlets with more complicated requirements such as
  [LLMs](/chains/guide#llm-chain-with-special-requirements).
