description: "Getting Started with Truss Chains"
---

<Warning>This is a beta feature and subject to breaking changes.</Warning>

In this guide, you'll follow the steps to install Truss chains and create and run your
first Chain.

# Installation

Truss chains is available in the latest version of Truss.

```bash
$ pip install truss --upgrade
```

# Creating your first chainlet

1. Create a new file for your chain (you can name it anything you want, but for this example we'll name it `hello.py`). You
can also create this file anywhere.
2. Add the following code to the file:

```python
import truss_chains as chains

class HelloWorld(chains.ChainletBase):
    remote_config = chains.RemoteConfig(
        docker_image=chains.DockerImage()
    )

    def run(self, num_repetitions: int) -> str:
        # Your user code goes here.
        return "Hello World! " * num_repetitions
```

This creates a chainlet that takes an integer, and return the string "Hello World!" that many times.

# Running it locally

Truss Chains supports a local development mode that allows you to run and test your chainlets locally.
To use this mode, add the following code to the end of your file:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with chains.run_local():
        my_hello_world = HelloWorld()
        result = my_hello_world.run(num_repetitions=3)

    print(result)
    # Hello World! Hello World! Hello World!
```

And simply run your Python file:

```
$ python hello.py
```

<Warning>
Note that this uses whatever resources are on your local computer. If your chainlet requires a GPU,
or Python dependencies that are not installed on your local machine, this local mode will not work.
</Warning>

# Deploying to Baseten

To deploy your chain to a remote like Baseten, add the following code to the end of your file (instead
of the local snippet):

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    chains.deploy_remotely(HelloWorld, chain_name="hello-world")
```

And run it with:

```
$ python hello.py
```

This will output a block like this:

```
INFO:root:Deploying truss model to Baseten`Test.HelloWorld` (publish=False, promote=False).
Compressing... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00
Uploading... ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━ 100% 0:00:00
INFO:root:🪵  View logs for your deployment at 'https://app.baseten.co/models/lqzrnre3/logs/qe7knpw'.
INFO:root:Deployed service: name='Test.HelloWorld' predict_url='https://model-lqzrnre3.api.baseten.co/deployment/qe7knpw/predict'.
```

After the deployment succeeds, you can invoke the chain by calling the `predict` endpoint (Grab the predict URL from the output above) with a POST request like this:

```bash
$ curl -X POST $PREDICT_URL \
  -H "Authorization: Api-Key $BASETEN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"num_repetitions": 10}'
# "Hello World! Hello World! Hello World! "
