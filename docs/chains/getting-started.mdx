This guide shows you how to install Truss Chains, create your first Chain and run it.

# Installation

Truss Chains is available in the a rc version of Truss.

```bash
$ pip install truss==0.9.11rc1
```

For deploying Chains remotely to Baseten you need a [Baseten account](https://app.baseten.co/signup).


# Creating your first *Chainlet*

1. Create a Chain project directory with a python file in it. You can chose a name and location, in this example we
assume the file is named `hello.py`.
1. Add a Chainlet subclass to the file:

```python
import truss_chains as chains

class HelloWorld(chains.ChainletBase):
    remote_config = chains.RemoteConfig(
        docker_image=chains.DockerImage(
            pip_requirements=["git+https://github.com/basetenlabs/truss.git"]
        )
    )

    def run(self, num_repetitions: int) -> str:
        return "Hello World! " * num_repetitions
```

This Chainlet takes an integer, and returns the string "Hello World!" repeated a variable number of times.

## Comments
* `run` contains your user-defined implementation and is the entrypoint to invoke a Chainlet. When
[chaining](/chains/chaining-chainlets) Chainlets, other Chainlets use the `run` methods of their dependency
Chainlets.
* To support input and output serialization in distributed execution, `run` must be fully type-annotated and with
<Tooltip tip="E.g. `int`, `str`, `list[float]`">primitive python types</Tooltip> or
<Tooltip tip="They have builtin JSON serialization.">[pydantic models](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/)</Tooltip>.
* A chainlet must not have any other *public* methods or attributes, besides `run`. You can use private methods to
structure you implementation.
* `remote_config` is required for controlling remote deployment and left with default values here. In
[advanced use cases](/chains/deps-and-resources) additional configuration, e.g. compute resources, is specified there.
* Bear in mind that Chains are intended for *distributed, replicated, remote execution*, so using global variables,
state and <Tooltip tip="E.g. changing classes and imported modules dynamically at runtime.">highly dynamic python
features</Tooltip> should be avoided as they might not work as intended.


# Local Debugging

Truss Chains supports a [run local mode](chains/deps-and-resources#running-it-locally) intended for
debugging and testing of your Chainlets. To use it, append a main section with test inputs to your file:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with Chains.run_local():
        my_hello_world = HelloWorld()
        result = my_hello_world.run(num_repetitions=3)

    print(result)
    # Hello World! Hello World! Hello World!
```

And run your Python file:

```
$ python hello.py
```

<Warning>
Note `run_local` uses whatever compute resources and dependencies available in your dev environment. If your Chainlet
requires a specific GPU or Python dependencies that are not available, it will not work.
For such cases refer to [mocking parts](chains/deps-and-resources#running-it-locally) of a Chain.
</Warning>

# Remote Deployment to Baseten

To deploy your Chain to in a remote hosting environment like [Baseten](https://www.baseten.co/), run the following
command:

```bash
truss chain deploy ./hello.py HelloWorld
```

This Truss command has the following structure:
`truss chain deploy [OPTIONS] SOURCE ENTRYPOINT` where `ENTRYPOINT` is the Chainlet class name in your python file.
For more options run `truss chain deploy --help`.

The deploy command results in an output like this:

```
INFO:root:Using project root for chain: `/home/marius-baseten/workbench/example`.
INFO:root:Generating truss model for chainlet `HelloWorld`.
INFO:root:Deploying chainlet `HelloWorld.HelloWorld` as truss model on Baseten (publish=False, promote=False).

Deployment succeeded.
You can run the chain with:
curl -X POST 'https://model<MODEL_ID>.api.baseten.co/development/predict' \
    -H "Authorization: Api-Key $BASETEN_API_KEY" \
    -d '<JSON_INPUT>'

```

Wait for the status to turn to `ACTIVE` and test invoking your Chain: copy+paste the displayed `curl` command
and replace `JSON_INPUT`:

```bash
$ curl -X POST $PREDICT_URL \
  -H "Authorization: Api-Key $BASETEN_API_KEY" \
  -d '{"num_repetitions": 10}'
# "Hello World! Hello World! Hello World! "
```

See the next section [Chaining Chainlets](/chains/chaining-chainlets) for how to deploy Chains with multiple
Chainlets.
