# Note for Truss Model users

 Chains is a fully re-designed SDK for writing ML models to be deployed on Baseten. It carries over some of the
features and concepts: all the good of Baseten (resource provisioning, autoscaling, fast cold starts and more) and
many of the config options from [Truss config](reference/config#yaml-syntax-help).
But it is not the same:
* Instead of creating a "truss directory" for a single monolithic model with a fixed structure of required files,
Chains encourages flexible and modular code organization. Specifically the development and interplay of
multiple "component models" (called *Chainlets*) in a coherent python code base benefitting from code completion
and type checking.
* The main focus - and new functionality - is to facilitate the definition of flexible multi-component workloads such
as multi-step pipelines or branching computational graphs.
* The Truss config YAML file has been replaced by inlining config in your code alongside with implementation.
A future feature in planning is to support file-based overrides of those config values.
* In the beta phase, not all Truss config options are integrated yet.
* In the beta phase, *Chainlets* are converted to Truss models and run as such on Baseten. This might be helpful
for technical understanding, but it should be seen as an implementation detail which might change in the future.
Conceptually they are not the same: `Chainlet != TrussModel`.


# Development Experience

Truss Chains is designed to run in a distributed, replicated environment - as
[baseten deployments](getting-started#remote-deployment-to-baseten) - but to enable a rapid development experience,
Truss Chains additionally has a [local debugging mode](getting-started#local-debugging) which allows you to iterate
more quickly.

Even though Chains might sometimes *feel* like working with "normal, local" python code, there are some constraints
and rules that must be followed to enable successful distributed, remote execution:

<Info>
* Chainlets cannot be naively instantiated. Follow the documentation guidelines, especially for
[linking](/chains/chaining-chainlets) multiple Chainlets to a Chain (i.e. one Chainlet using another Chainlet).

* Adhere to the [subclass contract](getting-started#comments) for Chainlets.

* The Chains framework runs some validations <Tooltip tip="This means at python module initialization,
i.e. before executing code.">as soon as a Chainlet
subclasses is defined</Tooltip> and if problems are found, error messages with suggestions are shown. So by frequently
running your file (even if it has no `__main__` section), you'll be notified early of potential issues.
