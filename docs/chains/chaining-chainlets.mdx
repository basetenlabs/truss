In the [previous section](chains/getting-started), we created a simple Chain with a single Chainlet.
In this section, we'll add a second Chainlet to the Chain. The toy example builds on top of
the previous Hello World example, and prints out "Hello World" with a random number of exclamation points at the end.

The computational graph for this Chain looks like this:

# The Code

Here's the code for this second Chain. Exactly like the first example, we put this all in a single Python file called `hello.py`.

```python
import random
import truss_chains as chains


class GenerateRandomNumber(chains.ChainletBase):
    """This chainlet generates a random number from 1 to `high_value`."""

    remote_config = chains.RemoteConfig(docker_image=chains.DockerImage())

    def run_remote(self, high_value: int) -> int:
        return random.randint(1, high_value)

class HelloWorld(chains.ChainletBase):
    """This chainlet calls the additional `GenerateRandomNumber` chainlet to get
    a random number, and then returns "Hello World" with that many exclamation
    marks added.
    """
    remote_config = chains.RemoteConfig(docker_image=chains.DockerImage())

    def __init__(
        self,
        # All chainlets have a `context` argument to allow accessing
        # resources such as secrets, config or data.
        context: chains.DeploymentContext = chains.depends_context(),
        # Dependency chainlets are added as special arguments to `__init__`.
        # The `provide` directive make sure in both local and remote mode
        # an appropriate instance is "injected".
        generate_random_number: GenerateRandomNumber = chains.depends(
            GenerateRandomNumber
        ),
    ):
        super().__init__(context)
        self._generate_random_number = generate_random_number

    def run_remote(self, high_value: int) -> str:
        random_number = self._generate_random_number.run_remote(high_value)
        return "Hello World" + ("!" * random_number)
```

Some comments:
* We use Dependency Injection to reference make other Chainlets callable within the current Chainlet.
This enables both local and remote execution, as well as testing these Chainlets in isolation.
The `provides` function here creates an instance of the `GenerateRandomNumber` Chainlet. In a local
context, you get a literal instance of that class, while in a remote context, it is an object where
the `run` method is executed on a remote server.
* You have to follow the shown pattern adding these Chainlets to the `__init__` arguments with type
annotations and using `provide`, to make it work.
* A plus is that you get type-checking and code-completion for these remote calls.


## Local Debugging

Add a main section with test inputs and printing of results:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    with chains.run_local():
        my_hello_world = HelloWorld()
        result = my_hello_world.run_remote(high_value=10)

    print(result)
    # Hello World! Hello World! Hello World! Hello World!

```

And run your Python file:

```bash
python hello.py
```

## Remote Deployment

To deploy your Chain remotely to Baseten, run the following command:

```bash
truss chains deploy ./hello.py HelloWorld
```

In this simple example, each Chainlet uses the same resources, so we would not necessarily need two Chainlets.
In the [next section](/chains/deps-and-resources), we show an example of using an LLM which requires a GPU and extra packages.
