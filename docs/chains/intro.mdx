<TOC />


Unlock the power of modular ML development with *Truss Chains*.
Seamlessly integrate multi-components models or and other data processing steps
into a single workflow.
Enjoy rapid development, scalable remote serving on Baseten, and speed ups
through horizontal scaling
and data chunking.

# Features

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Type-safe Remote Calls" icon="square-1">
    Call Chainlets from other Chainlets with ease: code-completion,
    type-checking, retries, error handling and data serialization - all
    included.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Run different computations on different hardware" icon="square-2">
    Configure each Chainlet to run with exactly the hardware and software it needs.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Local Debug Mode" icon="square-4">
    Local execution, in combination with mocking, facilitates a fast dev loop
    and testability.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pure Python Configuration" icon="square-3">
    Manage all your config in the code. No guessing of YAML schemas, no more
    undetected typos.
  </Card>

# Example Use Cases

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Chunked Audio Transcription" icon="forward-fast" >
    Transcribe large audio files by splitting them into smaller chunks and
    processing them in parallel, enabling transcription of 10+ hour files
    in minutes.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="RAG retrieval augmented generation" icon="book" >
    Set up RAG pipelines to augment LLM results with additional information
    from vector databases and other stores without having to set up any
    additional infrastructure.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Optimal scaling of multi-step models" icon="hand-holding-dollar" >
    For multi-step models, for instance, an image generation pipeline with
    an LLM step to refine a prompt, scale each step independently to
    optimize cost and performance.
  </Accordion>
