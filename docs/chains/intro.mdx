With a vanilla Truss, you can call a single model in an HTTP request. However, many inference workloads are
more complex - you might want to call multiple models in a sequence, or partition your input data into
smaller chunks and call a model for each chunk. *Truss Chains* is a framework for implementing these complex, modular
workloads.


<Accordion title="Note for Truss Model users.">
  Chains is a fully re-designed SDK for writing ML models to be deployed on Baseten. It carries over some of the
  features and concepts: all the good of Baseten (resource provisioning, autoscaling, fast cold starts and more) and
  many of the config options from [Truss config](reference/config#yaml-syntax-help).
  But it is not the same:
  * Instead of creating a "truss directory" for a single monolithic model with a fixed structure of required files,
  Chains encourages flexible and modular code organization. Specifically the development and interplay of
  multiple "component models" (called *Chainlets*) in a coherent python code base benefitting from code completion
  and type checking.
  * The main focus - and new functionality - is to facilitate the definition of flexible multi-component workloads such
  as multi-step pipelines or branching computational graphs.
  * The Truss config YAML file has been replaced by inlining config in your code alongside with implementation.
  A future feature in planning is to support file-based overrides of those config values.
  * In the beta phase, not all Truss config options are integrated yet.
  * In the beta phase, *Chainlets* are converted to Truss models and run as such on Baseten. This might be helpful
  for technical understanding, but it should be seen as an implementation detail which might change in the future.
  Conceptually they are not the same: `Chainlet != TrussModel`.

# Key Concepts

## Chainlet

The basic building block in a Truss Chain: it performs a specific computation. For example, running a
large ML model, but it can also be a simple function that transforms data. An useful feature is that a *Chainlet* can
call other *Chainlets*.
Each *Chainlet* is intended to be deployed remotely, with potentially multiple replicas and running in its own
environment (e.g. with specific compute hardware, autoscaling and software dependencies).

## Chain

A *Chain* is what you get if you connect multiple *Chainlets* to perform a meaningfully overarching task.
Each *Chain* has an *entrypoint* Chainlet to which requests are made by the client.
Internally, the different Chainlets call each other, thereby structuring and distributing the overall computation -
and eventually the *entrypoint* returns the end-to-end result back to the client.
You can imagine this like a "flow chart" or "computational graph".

Here's an example of a Chain that takes a large audio file, splits it into smaller chunks, and transcribes each chunk
 *in parallel* to speed up the transcription process - and then aggregates the results.

## Development Experience

Truss Chains is designed to run in a distributed, replicated environment - as
[baseten deployments](getting-started#remote-deployment-to-baseten) - but to enable a rapid development experience,
Truss Chains additionally has a [local debugging mode](getting-started#local-debugging) which allows you to iterate
more quickly.

Even though Chains might sometimes *feel* like working with "normal, local" python code, there are some constraints
and rules that must be followed to enable successful distributed, remote execution:

<Info>
* Chainlets cannot be naively instantiated. Follow the documentation guidelines, especially for
[linking](/chains/chaining-chainlets) multiple Chainlets to a Chain (i.e. one Chainlet using another Chainlet).

* Adhere to the [subclass contract](getting-started#comments) for Chainlets.

* The Chains framework runs some validations <Tooltip tip="This means at python module initialization,
i.e. before executing code.">as soon as a Chainlet
subclasses is defined</Tooltip> and if problems are found, error messages with suggestions are shown. So by frequently
running your file (even if it has no `__main__` section), you'll be notified early of potential issues.

# Hello World

Chains are powerful and have more advanced features explained in following sections. For starters, here is
a minimal "Hello World" example of Truss Chains.

```python
import truss_chains as chains

class HelloWorld(chains.ChainletBase):
    remote_config = chains.RemoteConfig(
        docker_image=chains.DockerImage())

    def run(self, num_repetitions: int) -> str:
        return "Hello World! " * num_repetitions
```

See [Getting Started](/chains/getting-started) for how to run this!
