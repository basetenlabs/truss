# Key Concepts

## Chainlet

The basic building block in a Truss Chain: it performs a specific computation.
For example, running a
large ML model, but it can also be a simple function that transforms data. Most
importantly: a *Chainlet* can
call other *Chainlets* - which will be *remote calls* when deployed.
Each *Chainlet* is intended to be deployed remotely, with potentially multiple
replicas and running in its own
environment (e.g. with specific compute hardware, autoscaling and software
dependencies).

## Chain

A *Chain* is the result of connecting multiple *Chainlets* to perform an
overarching task.
Each *Chain* has an *entrypoint* Chainlet to which requests are made by the
client.
Internally, the different Chainlets call each other, thereby structuring or
distributing the overall computation -
and eventually the *entrypoint* returns the final result back to the client.
You can imagine this like a "flow chart" or "computational graph".

Here's an example of a Chain that takes a large audio file, splits it into
smaller chunks, and transcribes each chunk
*in parallel* to speed up the transcription process - and then aggregates the
results.

## Note for Truss Model users

Chains is a fully re-designed SDK for writing ML models to be deployed on
Baseten. It carries over some of the
features and concepts: all the good of Baseten (resource provisioning,
autoscaling, fast cold starts and more) and
many of the config options
from [Truss config](reference/config#yaml-syntax-help).
But it is not the same:

* Instead of creating a "truss directory" for a single monolithic model with a
  fixed structure of required files,
  Chains encourages flexible and modular code organization. Specifically the
  development and interplay of
  multiple "component models" (called *Chainlets*) in a coherent python code
  base benefitting from code completion
  and type checking.
* The main focus - and new functionality - is to facilitate the definition of
  flexible multi-component workloads such
  as multi-step pipelines or branching computational graphs.
* The Truss config YAML file has been replaced by inlining config in your code
  alongside with implementation.
  A future feature in planning is to support file-based overrides of those
  config values.
* In the beta phase, not all Truss config options are integrated yet.
* In the beta phase, *Chainlets* are converted to Truss models and run as such
  on Baseten. This might be helpful
  for technical understanding, but it should be seen as an implementation detail
  which might change in the future.
  Conceptually they are not the same: `Chainlet != TrussModel`.
