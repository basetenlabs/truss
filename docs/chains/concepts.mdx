# Key Concepts

## Chainlet

The basic building block in a Truss Chain: it performs a specific computation. For example, running a
large ML model, but it can also be a simple function that transforms data. Most importantly: a *Chainlet* can
call other *Chainlets* - which will be *remote calls* when deployed.
Each *Chainlet* is intended to be deployed remotely, with potentially multiple replicas and running in its own
environment (e.g. with specific compute hardware, autoscaling and software dependencies).

## Chain

A *Chain* is the result of connecting multiple *Chainlets* to perform an overarching task.
Each *Chain* has an *entrypoint* Chainlet to which requests are made by the client.
Internally, the different Chainlets call each other, thereby structuring or distributing the overall computation -
and eventually the *entrypoint* returns the final result back to the client.
You can imagine this like a "flow chart" or "computational graph".

Here's an example of a Chain that takes a large audio file, splits it into smaller chunks, and transcribes each chunk
 *in parallel* to speed up the transcription process - and then aggregates the results.

## Note for Truss Model users

 Chains is a fully re-designed SDK for writing ML models to be deployed on Baseten. It carries over some of the
features and concepts: all the good of Baseten (resource provisioning, autoscaling, fast cold starts and more) and
many of the config options from [Truss config](reference/config#yaml-syntax-help).
But it is not the same:
* Instead of creating a "truss directory" for a single monolithic model with a fixed structure of required files,
Chains encourages flexible and modular code organization. Specifically the development and interplay of
multiple "component models" (called *Chainlets*) in a coherent python code base benefitting from code completion
and type checking.
* The main focus - and new functionality - is to facilitate the definition of flexible multi-component workloads such
as multi-step pipelines or branching computational graphs.
* The Truss config YAML file has been replaced by inlining config in your code alongside with implementation.
A future feature in planning is to support file-based overrides of those config values.
* In the beta phase, not all Truss config options are integrated yet.
* In the beta phase, *Chainlets* are converted to Truss models and run as such on Baseten. This might be helpful
for technical understanding, but it should be seen as an implementation detail which might change in the future.
Conceptually they are not the same: `Chainlet != TrussModel`.
