## Installation

Install Truss with:

```
pip install --upgrade truss
```

## Quickstart

As a quick example, we'll package a [text classification pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) from the open-source [`transformers` package](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

### Create a Truss

To get started, create a Truss with the following terminal command:

```
truss init text-classification
```

This will create an empty Truss at `./text-classification`.

### Implement the `Model` class

  <img src="/images/notebook-to-model.png" />
</Frame>

The model serving code goes in `./text-classification/model/model.py` in your newly created Truss.

```python
from typing import List
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs) -> None:
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input: str) -> List:
        return self._model(model_input)
```

There are two functions to implement:

* `load()` runs once when the model is spun up and is responsible for initializing `self._model`
* `predict()` runs each time the model is invoked and handles the inference. It can use any JSON-serializable type as input and output.

### Add model dependencies

The pipeline model relies on Transformers and PyTorch. These dependencies must be specified in the Truss config.

In `./text-classification/config.yaml`, find the line `requirements`. Replace the empty list with:

```yaml
requirements:
  - torch==2.0.1
  - transformers==4.30.0
```

No other configuration needs to be changed.

## Deployment

You can deploy a Truss to your [Baseten](https://baseten.co) account with:

```
cd ./text-classification
truss push
```

Truss will support other remotes soon, starting with AWS SageMaker.
