In this quickstart guide, you will package and deploy a [text classification pipeline model](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines).

<Tip>
If you want to go step-by-step through these concepts and more, check out the [learn model deployment tutorial](/learn/intro) for a detailed introduction to model deployment and Truss.
</Tip>

## Install the Truss package

Install the latest version of Truss with:

```sh
pip install --upgrade truss
```

## Create a Truss

To get started, create a Truss with the following terminal command:

```sh
truss init text-classification
```

When prompted, give your Truss a name like `Text classification`.

Then, navigate to the newly created directory:

```sh
cd text-classification
```

## Implement the `Model` class

One of the two essential files in a Truss is `model/model.py`. In this file, you write a `Model` class: an interface between the ML model that you're packaging and the model server that you're running it on.

There are two member functions that you must implement in the `Model` class:

* `load()` loads the model onto the model server. It runs exactly once when the model server is spun up or patched.
* `predict()` handles model inference. It runs every time the model server is called.

Here's the complete `model/model.py` for the text classification model:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Code">
```python model/model.py
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input):
        return self._model(model_input)
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Diff">
```diff model/model.py
+ from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
-       pass
+       self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input):
-       return model_input
+       return self._model(model_input)
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Add model dependencies

The other essential file in a Truss is `config.yaml`, which configures the model serving environment. For a complete list of the config options, see [the config reference](/reference/config).

The pipeline model relies on [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). These dependencies must be specified in the Truss config.

In `config.yaml`, find the line `requirements`. Replace the empty list with:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Code">
```yaml config.yaml
requirements:
  - torch==2.0.1
  - transformers==4.30.0
```
</Tab>
<Tab title="Diff">
```diff config.yaml
- requirements: []
+ requirements:
+   - torch==2.0.1
+   - transformers==4.30.0
```
</Tab>
</Tabs>

No other configuration is needed.

## Deploy the Truss

Truss is maintained by [Baseten](https://baseten.co), which provides infrastructure for running ML models in production. We'll use Baseten as the remote host for your model.

### Get an API key

To set up the Baseten remote, you'll need a [Baseten API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/account/api_keys). If you don't have a Baseten account, no worries, just [sign up for an account](https://app.baseten.co/signup/) and you'll be issued plenty of free credits to get you started.

### Run `truss push`

With your Baseten API key ready to paste when prompted, you can deploy your model:

```sh
truss push
```

You can monitor your model deployment from [your model dashboard on Baseten](https://app.baseten.co/models/).

## Invoke the model

After the model has finished deploying, you can invoke it from the terminal.

**Invocation**

```sh
truss predict -d '"Truss is awesome!"'
```

**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "label": "POSITIVE",
    "score": 0.999873161315918
  }
]
```
