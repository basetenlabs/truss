Your model server may need to use access tokens, API keys, passwords, or other secret values. Truss gives you everything you need to use secrets securely.

## Setting secrets in `config.yaml`

If your model needs a secret, first add its name in `config.yaml` with a placeholder value:

```yaml config.yaml
secrets:
  hf_access_token: null
```

<Warning>
Never set the actual value of a secret in the `config.yaml` file. Only put secret values in secure places, like the Baseten workspace secret manager.
</Warning>

## Using secrets in `model.py`

Secrets are passed to your `Model` class as a keyword argument in `init`. They can be accessed with:

```py model/model.py
def __init__(self, **kwargs):
    self._secrets = kwargs["secrets"]
```

You can then use the `self._secrets` dictionary in the `load` and `predict` functions:

```py model/model.py
def load(self):
    self._model = pipeline(
        "fill-mask",
        model="baseten/docs-example-gated-model",
        use_auth_token=self._secrets["hf_access_token"]
    )
```

## Storing secrets on your remote

On your remote host, such as your Baseten account, store both the secret name and value before deploying your model. On Baseten, you can add secrets to your workspace on the [secrets workspace settings page](https://app.baseten.co/settings/secrets).

Make sure to use the same name (case sensitive) as used in the Truss on the remote.

## Deploying with secrets

For additional security, models don't have access to secrets by default. To deploy a model and give it access to secrets, pass the `--trusted` flag during `truss push` as follows:

```sh
truss push --trusted
```

Your model will be deployed with access to secrets stored on your remote.
