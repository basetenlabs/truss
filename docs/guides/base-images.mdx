Model serving enviroments will often be standardized as container images to avoid wrangling python, system, and other requirements needed to run your model on every deploy.
Leverage your existing container artifacts by bringing your own base image to Truss.

## Setting a base image in config.yaml

To specify a base image to build a truss container image from in your `config.yaml` configure a `base_image`.

```yaml config.yaml
base_image:
  image: <image_name:tag>
  python_executable_path: <path-to-python>
```

where `python_executable_path` is a path to a python executable with which to run your server.

## Example usage

This [example truss](https://github.com/basetenlabs/truss/tree/main/examples/nemo-titanet) demonstrates how to properly configure a base image for Nvidia NeMo TitaNet:

```yaml config.yaml
base_image:
  image: nvcr.io/nvidia/nemo:23.03
  python_executable_path: /usr/bin/python
apply_library_patches: true
bundled_packages_dir: packages
data_dir: data
requirements:
- PySoundFile
live_reload: false
resources:
  accelerator: T4
  cpu: 2500m
  memory: 4512Mi
  use_gpu: true
secrets: {}
spec_version: '2.0'
system_packages:
- python3.8-venv
```

## Configuring private base images with build time secrets

Secrets of the form `DOCKER_REGISTRY_<REGISTRY_URL>` will be supplied to your model build to authenticate image pulls from private container registries.
For information on where to store secret values see the [secrets guide](/guides/secrets#storing-secrets-on-your-remote).

For example, to configure docker credentials to a private dockerhub repository your `config.yaml` should include the following secret and placeholder:

```yaml config.yaml
secrets:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY_https://index.docker.io/v1/: null
```

along with a configured Baseten secret `DOCKER_REGISTRY_https://index.docker.io/v1/` with a base64 encoded `username:password` secret value:

```sh
echo -n 'username:password' | base64
```

To add docker credentials for gcloud artifact registry provide an [access token](https://cloud.google.com/artifact-registry/docs/docker/authentication#token) as the secret value.
For example, to configure authentication for a repository in `us-west2` your `config.yaml` should include the following secret and placeholder:

```yaml config.yaml
secrets:
  DOCKER_REGISTRY_us-west2-docker.pkg.dev: null
```
