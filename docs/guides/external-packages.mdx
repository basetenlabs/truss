You might encounter a situation where you have to incorporate a third-party package into your truss. Truss has a few different mechanisms to support this.

## Using the packages directory

Each truss, when initialized, comes with a `packages` directory. Inside this directory, you can place any additional python packages that your would like to reference inside your truss.
For example, your packages directory might look like this:

```
packages/
    package_1/
        subpackage/
            script.py
    package_2/
        utils.py
        another_script.py
```

You can import these packages inside your `model.py` like so:

```python model.py
from package_1.subpackage.script import run_script
from package_2.utils import RandomClass

class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        random_class = RandomClass()

    def load(self):
        run_script()

    ...
    ...
    ...
```

These packages get bundled with your truss at build time. Because of this, it's ideal to use this method when your packages are small.
But what if you want to reference packages *outside* your truss?

## Using the external packages directory

Let's say you have the following setup:

```
stable-diffusion/
    model/
        model.py
        __init__.py
    config.yaml
super_cool_awesome_plugin/
    plugin1/
        script.py
    plugin2/
        run.py
```

In this case the package you want to import, `super_cool_awesome_plugin`, is outside the truss. You could move the `super_cool_awesome_plugin` directory inside the `packages` directory if you wanted to, but there is another option.
Inside the `config.yaml` you can specify the path to external packages by using the key `external_package_dirs`. Under this key, you can provide a list of external packages that you would like to use in your truss.
Here is what that would look like for the example above:

```yaml config.yaml
environment_variables: {}
external_package_dirs:
- ../super_cool_awesome_plugin/
model_name: Stable Diffusion
python_version: py39
...
...
...
```

<Tip>
### Configuring the external_package_dirs path

The path of the external packages must be relative to the config.yaml file.
So `super_cool_awesome_plugin/` is parallel to `stable-diffusion/`, but it's one directory up from the config.yaml so we use `../super_cool_awesome_plugin`.

</Tip>

Here's how you can reference your packages inside `model.py`:

```python model.py
from super_cool_awesome_plugin.plugin1.script import cool_constant
from super_cool_awesome_plugin.plugin2.run import AwesomeRunner

class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        awesome_runner = AwesomeRunner()

    def load(self):
        awesome_runner.run(cool_constant)

    ...
    ...
    ...
```

Using these techniques, you can incorporate external packages inside your truss.
