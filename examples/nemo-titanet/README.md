## Nemo Titanet: Custom Image Example
[Titanet](https://catalog.ngc.nvidia.com/orgs/nvidia/teams/nemo/models/titanet_large) is a speaker
recognition model from Nvidia, that's realeased as part of the [NeMo Toolkit](https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo).

This example demonstrates how to easily package this model (and any other nemo model) using
the nvidia base image instead of having to recreate all the dependencies.
