# Truss

**The simplest way to serve AI/ML models in production**

## Why Truss?

* **Write once, run anywhere:** Package and test model code, weights, and dependencies with a model server that behaves the same in development and production.
* **Fast developer loop:** Implement your model with fast feedback from a live reload server, and skip Docker and Kubernetes configuration with a batteries-included model serving environment.
* **Support for all Python frameworks**: From `transformers` and `diffusors` to `PyTorch` and `Tensorflow` to `XGBoost` and `sklearn`, Truss supports models created with any framework, even entirely custom models.

## Installation

Install Truss with:

```
pip install --upgrade truss
```

## Quickstart

As a quick example, we'll package a [text classification pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/pipelines) from the open-source [`transformers` package](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers).

### Create a Truss

To get started, create a Truss with the following terminal command:

```sh
truss init text-classification
```

When prompted, give your Truss a name like `Text classification`.

Then, navigate to the newly created directory:

```sh
cd text-classification
```

### Implement the model

One of the two essential files in a Truss is `model/model.py`. In this file, you write a `Model` class: an interface between the ML model that you're packaging and the model server that you're running it on.

There are two member functions that you must implement in the `Model` class:

* `load()` loads the model onto the model server. It runs exactly once when the model server is spun up or patched.
* `predict()` handles model inference. It runs every time the model server is called.

Here's the complete `model/model.py` for the text classification model:

```python
from transformers import pipeline


class Model:
    def __init__(self, **kwargs):
        self._model = None

    def load(self):
        self._model = pipeline("text-classification")

    def predict(self, model_input):
        return self._model(model_input)
```

### Add model dependencies

The other essential file in a Truss is `config.yaml`, which configures the model serving environment. For a complete list of the config options, see [the config reference](https://truss.baseten.co/reference/config).

The pipeline model relies on [Transformers](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/). These dependencies must be specified in the Truss config.

In `config.yaml`, find the line `requirements`. Replace the empty list with:

```yaml
requirements:
  - torch==2.0.1
  - transformers==4.30.0
```

No other configuration is needed.

## Deployment

Truss is maintained by [Baseten](https://baseten.co), which provides infrastructure for running ML models in production. We'll use Baseten as the remote host for your model.

Other remotes are coming soon, starting with AWS SageMaker.

### Get an API key

To set up the Baseten remote, you'll need a [Baseten API key](https://app.baseten.co/settings/account/api_keys). If you don't have a Baseten account, no worries, just [sign up for an account](https://app.baseten.co/signup/) and you'll be issued plenty of free credits to get you started.

### Run `truss push`

With your Baseten API key ready to paste when prompted, you can deploy your model:

```sh
truss push
```

You can monitor your model deployment from [your model dashboard on Baseten](https://app.baseten.co/models/).

### Invoke the model

After the model has finished deploying, you can invoke it from the terminal.

**Invocation**

```sh
truss predict -d '"Truss is awesome!"'
```

**Response**

```json
[
  {
    "label": "POSITIVE",
    "score": 0.999873161315918
  }
]
```
