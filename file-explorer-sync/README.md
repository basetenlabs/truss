# File Explorer Sync

Automatically expands and collapses directories in the file explorer as you open and close files in the editor.

## Features

- **Automatic Syncing**: Automatically reveals files in the explorer when you open them
- **Smart Collapsing**: Optionally collapse directories when all files in them are closed
- **Configurable**: Multiple settings to customize the behavior
- **Status Bar Integration**: Quick toggle via status bar icon
- **Non-intrusive**: Keeps focus on the editor by default

## Commands

- `Sync File Explorer Now`: Manually sync the explorer with the current file
